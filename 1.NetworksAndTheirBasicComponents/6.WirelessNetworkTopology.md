##### Wireless Network Topology

- Two different modes wireless network operates are:

- Infrastructure Mode
  - Most common type of wireless network
  - Requires centralized management
  - Uses a wireless access point as a centralized point like a start topology
  - Supports wireless security controls

- Ad Hoc Mode
  - Decentralized wireless network
  - No routers or access points are required
  - Forwarding decisions for data on the network are made dynamically
  - Allows creation/joining of networks "on-the-fly"
  - Creates P2P connections

- Wireless Mesh Topology 
  - Interconnection of different types of nodes or devices
  - Consists of clients, routers, and gateways
  - Utilizes different radio frequencies to extent and expand access
  - Reliable and redundant connections
