##### Network Resources

- How data is being moved around the network. And we generally consider following 2 ways fo doing that:
  - Client/Server Model
  - Peer to Peer Model

- Client/Server Model:
  - Uses dedicated server to provide access to files, scanners, printers, and other resources.
  - Administration and backup is easier since resources are located on a few key servers.
  - Benefits:
    - Centralized administration
    - Easier management
    - Better scalability
  - Drawbacks:
    - Higher cost
    - Requires dedicated resources
    - Requires network operating system
    
- Peer-to-Peer Model
  - Peers(PCs) share resources (files/printers) with each other directly.
  - Administration and backup is more difficult, as resources are located on a many PCs which adds to the administrative burden.
  - Benefits:
    - Lower cost
    - No dedicated resources required
    - No specialized operating system required
  - Drawbacks:
    - Decentralized management
    - Inefficient for large networks
    - Poor scalability
