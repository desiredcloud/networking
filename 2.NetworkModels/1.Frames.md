##### Frames

- Devices on a network send and receive data in descreet chunks called frames (or packets)
- 1 Frame can be of 1500 bytes long (containers 10000 - 1's and 0's)
- The Network Card(nic) creates the frame and shoots into the network
- And when we receive from network, the Network Card un-frames and sends it to the target application
- Frames are created and destroyed inside the network interface card (NIC)
